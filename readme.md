# Social Navigation of a Mobile Robot

The goal of this work is to implement and analyze different methods that enable robots
to navigate through crowded environments, such as those that may be encountered in
shopping malls, road side walks, or industries.  The two key methods considered here for
planning a robot’s trajectory safe from moving and static obstacles are neural-network
based estimation of a human’s trajectory and social forces method.  We integrate these
broad methods with other primitive shortest path-planning algorithms such as A* search
to find a collision-free shortest path for the robotic agent through a crowded environment.
To  analyze  the  said  techniques  we  use  certain  existing  simulation  environments  and
present a comparison between the approaches.
